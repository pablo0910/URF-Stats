# URF-Stats
Application which calculates some URF LoL mode Statistics

Android Application which calculates some Stats related with URF LoL Mode Games.
First of all you must put 2 dates. Stats will be calculated with games between those dates. Once you add one period of time, this data will remain saved on your device. Next time you add a date new data will be added and compared with the old.

When data has already been retrieved from Riot Api, you'll be able to see the stats.

This APP uses new Android Lollipop widgets such as RecycleView.

Enjoy it ;)
